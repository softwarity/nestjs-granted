# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to `@softwarity/nestjs-granted`.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/softwarity/nestjs-granted.git
cd nestjs-granted
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
```

The test suites need **Node.js ≥ 24.9**: NestJS 12 ships as ESM only, and Jest loads it through its `require(esm)` support (the `test` scripts pass `--experimental-vm-modules` for you).

## Documentation site

The doc site is an Angular app under `docs/`. To run it locally:

```bash
cd docs
npm ci
npm start
```

It is deployed to GitHub Pages automatically on push to `main` via the
`deploy-doc.yml` workflow.

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode, 2-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Don't restate the code.
- `npm run lint` must pass with 0 errors.
- `npm test` must pass.

## Releasing

Releases go through the [`softwarity/release-flow`](https://github.com/softwarity/release-flow) action. Never bump the version or write a version heading by hand.

1. Describe every change under `## NEXT RELEASE` in `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
2. **Actions → Create Tag/Release → Run workflow**, then pick `patch` / `minor` / `major`.
3. The workflow checks the npm token, lints, tests and builds. Then release-flow bumps `package.json`, renames `## NEXT RELEASE` to the new version, tags `vX.Y.Z`, publishes the GitHub Release from those notes and reopens an empty `## NEXT RELEASE`.
4. The tag triggers `tag.yml`, which lints, tests, builds and runs `npm publish`.

The tag is pushed with the `PAT_TOKEN` secret: a push made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not trigger `tag.yml`.

### npm token

The repository must have an `NPM_TOKEN` secret set in **Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions**. Create it on npmjs.com under **Access Tokens → Granular
Access Token**, scoped to `@softwarity/nestjs-granted` with publish permission.
